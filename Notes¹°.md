What do i need to do first?
?/11 The first thing is to create a form of login to access the content, for this i need to create a entrance for my site. So i'm goin to do one in JS, HTML and css just to have a good entrance.
12/11 So i did a entrance and now i'm atualizating it.
This is taking long as i did'n know that would take.
19/11 - i learned how to do a auth but i still need some extras, like cookies and do for real a login, this still doesn't work, i'll need to work in the core of the app also because i didin't nothing from the real form of the app.
