What do i need to do first?
05/11 The first thing is to create a form of login to access the content, for this i need to create a entrance for my site. So i'm goin to do one in JS, HTML and css just to have a good entrance.

12/11 So i did a entrance and now i'm atualizating it.
This is taking long as i did'n know that would take.

19/11 - i learned how to do a auth but i still need some extras, like cookies and do for real a login, this still doesn't work, i'll need to work in the core of the app also because i didin't nothing from the real form of the app.
So i put in my application a Guart, it can be described as a Guardian that take a crucial part of the code and leave it to be only accessed by ADM, a coloquial way to put someone that can do more things in this app.

21/11 - Probably my last presencial day in Intelbras, i just wish would be diferent, but it is what is.
In this day i wanna try to make the app works, as it should, for this i need to:
-See if the registration is very connected with every part;
-Check if every funcionality make sense in the porpose of sending a user, e-mail and a password (RGN is not going any were, giving a 404 error that means that the app may not be very directioned to were sould be);
-Check if the app have a way/path to go into my db, if i solve the oder problems it should work as i thing is.

Atualizações: 
The sistem is officially started to working as it should, i'm happy
